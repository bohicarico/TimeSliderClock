# TimeSliderClock
G-code, images and spreadsheet manifest for the time slider clock designed by Mr. Hans Andersson

I discovered this incredible clock on Instructables.   https://www.instructables.com/Time-Slider/
I've been obsessed with building it since March of 2023. In May of 2023 I printed my first 3D parts for the project.  To help me keep better track of the parts I had and those I needed, I created a simple spreadsheet.  

10/4/2023 - I completed the 3D parts printing milestone, reaching 100% done.  
10/4/2023 - I completed 99% of gathering the fiddly bits, screws, wires, etc. to complete the clock. 
            The wood strip is the last piece. I will get the wood and cut it to proper dimensions the first week of October                2023.
